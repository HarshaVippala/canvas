# Next.js Web Application Project

## Project Overview
This project is a modern web application built using Next.js, a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and other performance optimizations. The application demonstrates best practices in modern web development and showcases a responsive, user-friendly interface.

## Key Features
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improved performance and SEO optimization
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Fast page loads with pre-rendered content
- **API Routes**: Backend functionality within the Next.js framework
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach for all screen sizes
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, intuitive user interface with smooth interactions

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js (React)
- **Styling**: CSS Modules / Styled Components / Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API / Redux (if applicable)
- **Data Fetching**: SWR / React Query
- **Deployment**: Vercel / Netlify

## Project Structure
The application follows Next.js's file-based routing system:
- `pages/`: Contains all route components
- `components/`: Reusable UI components
- `public/`: Static assets like images and fonts
- `styles/`: Global styles and theme configurations
- `lib/`: Utility functions and helpers
- `api/`: API routes and data fetching logic

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14.x or later
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/HarshaVippala/canvas.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Development Workflow
1. Create new pages in the `pages` directory
2. Build reusable components in the `components` directory
3. Style components using the preferred styling solution
4. Implement data fetching using SWR or React Query
5. Test on different devices and browsers

## Performance Optimization
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Efficient data fetching with SWR
- Minimized JavaScript bundles
- Optimized fonts and assets

## Deployment
The application can be easily deployed to Vercel, which is optimized for Next.js projects:
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Import the project to Vercel
3. Configure build settings if needed
4. Deploy
